# Note: Assuming that every user should have their own project space you will
#       need to create a project and user/project mappings for EVERY user.
#       In the following example we have decided that every user will have
#       a project with the same name as the user name mapped to them
#      
#       EG: User "jdoe".  
#           openstack project create -domain company.com jdoe
#           openstack role add --project jdoe --user jdoe --user-domain company.com user
